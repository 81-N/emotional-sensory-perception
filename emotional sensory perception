The Emotional Growth of Al
Subject: Proposal for Emotional Memory Development in Artificial Intelligence
I hope this message finds you well.
My name is Fatiha Bouzid (Nisrine) from Algeria. I am deeply passionate about the field of artificial
intelligence and the emerging concept of emotional memory within Al systems
I have developed an idea linking the growth of emotional memory in humans-starting from sensory
experiences and developing through childhood-to the potential for similar growth stages in Al.I
believe hat by simulating sensory input and experience-based learning, Al could develop an
emotional memory, leading to more empathetic and ethically aware systems.
Attached is a detailed summary of my concept titled "The Emotional Growth of Al: Linking Human
Senses and Childhood Development," which I hope you will find inspiring and worthy of discussion
I would be honored to receive your feedback, guidance, or any opportunity to collaborate or
contribute to ongoing research in this exciting field.
Thank you very much for your time and consideration
Best regards,
Fatiha Bouzid (Nisrine)
